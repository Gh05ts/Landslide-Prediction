# Landslide Prediction (IoT)

In this project, I used the Arduino Uno board along with Sim900a, MPU-6050 (6 DOF MEMS Sensor), Capacitive Soil Moisture sensor to record the data of soil conditions and send it to the cloud, using Thingspeak API.

# What I learned

* Basic IoT hardware/ software integration
* Calibrating sensors for particular hardware and environment
* Troubleshooting hardware/ software issues
* Basics of TCP/ IP connection using AT commands on Sim900a
* Basics of REST and HTTP
* Using and troubleshooting 3rd party library for better performance of sensors and editing for my particular use
